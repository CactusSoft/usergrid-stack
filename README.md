## Getting Started

Note: The easiest way to run Usergrid is to download our latest nightly, pre-built jar:

    curl -O https://usergrid.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Usergrid%20Nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/org.usergrid$usergrid-launcher/artifact/org.usergrid/usergrid-launcher/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/usergrid-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    
Then start Usergrid with:

    java -jar usergrid-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Usergrid is now running at `http://localhost:8080/`.

You can use our admin UI on it by visiting [http://apigee.github.com/usergrid-portal/?api_url=http://localhost:8080](http://apigee.github.com/usergrid-portal/?api_url=http://localhost:8080)

## Requirements

* JDK 1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* Maven (http://maven.apache.org/)

## Building

From the command line, go to the usergrid directory and type the following:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

If you don't want to do a full build, you can download a [pre-built version of the launcher app](https://usergrid.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Usergrid%20Nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/org.usergrid$usergrid-launcher/artifact/org.usergrid/usergrid-launcher/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/usergrid-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) from our Cloudbees nightlies.

## Running

Usergrid-core contains the persistence layer and shared utilities for powering the Usergrid service. The services layer is contained in usergrid-services and exposes a higher-level API that's used by the usergrid-rest web services tier.

You can run Usergrid from the command-line from the
jar in the usergrid/standalone project:

    java -jar standalone/target/usergrid-standalone-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

After startup, your instance will be available on localhost, port 8080.
To check itâ€™s running properly, you can try loading our status page:

    curl http://localhost:8080/status

You can also run it as a webapp in Tomcat, by deploying the ROOT.war file generated in the usergrid/rest project.

## Using the Admin Portal

By default, the [Usergrid admin portal](https://github.com/apigee/usergrid-portal) points to our production servers at `api.usergrid.com`. However, by specifying an api_url argument in the query string, you can have it point to
your local instance instead. For example, you could reuse the version of the admin portal we host on github and have that point to your local cluster by opening the following URL in your browser:
`http://apigee.github.com/usergrid-portal/?api_url=http://localhost:8080`

The same trick would work if you used a local copy of the portal code served from your own machine or servers.
